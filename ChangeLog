	  handled.

	* Misc: Several smaller fixes, decrease verbosity.

	* Version 0.2 released.

	* Lookup: It works now. Also, the D-Bus interface has been changed to
	  enable requesting a specific output format.

	* Insert: Pictures can be added by passing in the raw picture data
	  bytes over D-Bus.

	* Cache: Clean up the mess when failing to insert something into the
	  cache structure.

	* Image conversion: Using ImageMagick instead of GraphicsMagick. Also
	  stripping comment, dates, and other meta data from converted files.

	* Image conversion: Only supporting 120x120 PNG because this is what
	  we need right now.

	* What's missing: Garbage collection; cache structure check (kind of
	  an fsck for the cache).

2017-02-01  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* First version. This version is primarily useful for first
	  integration into our distribution.
